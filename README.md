# Welcome

Welcome to FlexChia, a Chia blockchain pool service.  
CHIA Network blockchain is one of the leading eco friendly crypto currencies which may resolve excessive PoW energy dependency.  
However, the initial version of PLOT file, which now we use for Farming, had pool running restriction despite its innovative concept of PoST.  
Even a sharp growth of Net-Space accelerated the need of pooling system.

FlexChia Pool is now preparing the initial steps of Chia Pool realization according to the official Pool Protocol(Hereafter, OPP) release to satisfy those needs.

# Who we are

FlexChia Team is based on South Korea but there is no border for all farmers. No need VISA for entry.  
We just appriciate for your joinning and hope to grow together. 

FlexChia Pool have distinctive strength for 2 way pool farming methode support,  
* FlexChia Protocol (Unportable Plot) - For Existing Plots
* Official Chia Pool Protocol (Portable Plot) - For Plots to be replotted

As you already know, the existing plot (Hereafter, Unportable Plot) does not support pooling system due to its own restriction.  
You may say 'Yes...' because there is a pool, just flashed into our head. Yes, IF you are brave enough to submit your mnemonic words.  
.... However, it will force us to burden the worries of security always, as you know.  

so, we'd like to prouldy introduce our FlexChia Pool Protocol and its miner, which may allow you to liberate from thoes worries of security and to use Unportable Plot for pooling, as well.

# FlexChia Protocol(FCP)

You can join to FlexChia Pool with your own Original Unportable Plots by using FlexChia Protocol miner. It doesn't require any of your secret infomation such as mnemonic words, etc. The miner binary just checks your farming functionality and verifies your plots periodically to calculate and reward your Net-Space contributions.

_ FCP Technical details TBA _

For binary miner, we are considering between openning the source or audit by some credible source.

We, Flexchia Pool, also plan to support Official Chia Pool Protocol naturally as soon as it'll be released.
We are doing utmost efforts in order to cater for farmer's demands and flexibility of farming environment.
