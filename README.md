# Welcome

Welcome to FlexChia, a Chia blockchain pool service.
CHIA Network blockchain is one of the leading eco friendly crypto currencies which may resolve excessive PoW energy demands. 
However, the initial version of PLOT files, which allows Farming, had pool running restriction despite its innovative concept of PoST.

You can join to FlexChia Pool with your own OG(Original) plots by using FlexChia Protocol miner. It doesn't require your secret infomations such as mnemonic words, etc. 
The miner binary just checks your farming functionality and verifies your plots periodically to calculate and reward your Net-Space contributions.

We, Flexchia Pool, also plan to support Official Chia Pool Protocol naturally as soon as it'll be released.
We are doing utmost efforts in order to cater for farmer's demands and flexibility of farming environment.
