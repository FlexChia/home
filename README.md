# Welcome

Welcome to FlexChia, a Chia blockchain pool service.  
CHIA Network blockchain is one of the leading eco friendly crypto currencies which may resolve excessive PoW energy dependency.  
However, the initial version of PLOT file, which we use now for Farming, had pool running restriction despite its innovative concept of PoST.  
Even a sharp growth of Net-Space accelerated the need of pooling system.

FlexChia Pool is now preparing the initial steps of Chia Pool realization according to the official Pool Protocol(Hereafter, OPP) release to satisfy those needs.

# Who we are

FlexChia Team is based on South Korea but there is no border for all farmers. No need VISA for entry.  
We just appriciate for your joinning. We hope grow together. 

FlexChia Pool have distinctive strength for 2 way pool farming methodes supports,  
* FlexChia Protocol (Unportable Plot) - Existing 
* Official Pool Protocol (Portable Plot) - To be replotted

As you already know, the existing plot (Hereafter, Unportable Plot) does not support pooling system due to its own restriction.  
You may can say 'Yes...' because there is a pool, just flashed into our head. Yes, IF you are brave enough to submit your mnemonic words. 
.... However, it will force us to burden the worries of security always, as you know. 

so, we'd like to prouldy introduce our FlexChia Pool Protocol and its miner, which may allow you to liberate from thoes worries of security and to use exixisting Plot files(unportable Plot) for pooling.

# FlexChia Protocol(FCP)

You can join to FlexChia Pool with your own OG(Original) plots by using FlexChia Protocol miner. It doesn't require your secret infomations such as mnemonic words, etc. 
The miner binary just checks your farming functionality and verifies your plots periodically to calculate and reward your Net-Space contributions.

We, Flexchia Pool, also plan to support Official Chia Pool Protocol naturally as soon as it'll be released.
We are doing utmost efforts in order to cater for farmer's demands and flexibility of farming environment.
